- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mageOfstructs
- I'm a C++ Dev with more than two years of experience. My upload schedule may say otherwise, but I code nearly all the time (only need to learn push requests).
- My current projects are: 
-   - a console emulator
-   - simple encryption algorithm
-   - and currently work in progress is [SPOILER ALERT]

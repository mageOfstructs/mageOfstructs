- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mageOfstructs
- I'm a Java Dev with more than three years of experience. I spend a large amount of my time on Arch linux (did I mention that I use Arch btw?) programming for school or some private projects. My main focus at the time is becoming better at low-level, so my next project will probably written in C.
- My current projects are:
  - Maybe an interpreter, with funny error msgs and...
  - Oh, uh. That's a secret!

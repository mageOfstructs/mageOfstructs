# mageOfStructs

- hobby programmer since 2021/22
- Some of the languages I'm familiar with:
    - Rust
    - C
    - Java
    - JavaScript (Browser/Nodejs)
    - BASH
    - Lua
    - TypeScript
- I have a tendency to write stuff myself instead of looking for some library, so expect that in many of my hobby projects.
- I use arch btw
- FOSS is the thing that will save computing, screw planned obsolescence
